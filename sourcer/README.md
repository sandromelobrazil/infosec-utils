This small script allows to view the source code of a specified URL in a text area field so that the content fetched from a server does not get written to the HTML and cached on the HDD, potentially triggering an AV alert or worse, in case a malicious URL was requested.
Also, it notifies you if there's password fields seen somewhere in the source, suggesting this may be a credential harvesting attempt.
